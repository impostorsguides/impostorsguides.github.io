<p>If you want to follow along with some of the RBENV-specific experiments I describe on this site, the first step is to install RBENV on your machine.</p>

<p><strong>Even if you've already installed RBENV</strong>, you'll want to read this post, since there's a good chance you'll need to re-install RBENV from source (as opposed to via Homebrew or similar).</p>

<!--more-->
<p>If you'd rather not do this, you can still follow along with the RBENV code via <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/tree/c4395e58201966d9f90c12bd6b7342e389e7a4cb" target="_blank">its Github repo</a>, or by cloning said repo to your machine.  You'll still be able to perform any experiment we do in this guide which isn't RBENV-specific.</p>

<p>I'm writing this tutorial on a Macbook running macOS, and I'll be using macOS-specific installation instructions and commands throughout.</p>

<h2>Ensuring you have no other version managers installed</h2>

<p>Admittedly, the best candidates for reading this guide are people who already use RBENV as their Ruby version manager.  As you'll soon see, users of other version managers (such as rvm, asdf, chruby, etc.) will face more and bigger hurdles than users of RBENV (more on why in a minute).</p>

<p>With that in mind, we'll need to make sure you don't have a different Ruby version manager installed, such as RVM.  If you do, that will represent a blocker to your continuing this guide, since you'll have different version managers competing to manage your Ruby version.  This could introduce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715135727/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35808103/rvm-and-rbenv-on-the-same-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unexpected behavior</a> and negatively impact your usage of Ruby.</p>

<p>We can check for the most popular Ruby version managers by using the <code>which</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ which asdf
asdf not found
$ which rvm
rvm not found
$ which chruby
chruby not found
$ </code></pre>

<p>If you see anything other than "not found" for <code>which asdf</code>, <code>which rvm</code>, and <code>which chruby</code>, you likely have another version manager on your machine.  In that case, you'll need to make a decision about which version manager you want to use.  <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Comparison-of-version-managers" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>RBENV's Github page has a guide</a> on the pros and cons of the various version managers out there.</p>

<p>If you don't have other version managers on your machine, feel free to move on to the next section.</p>

<h2>Making sure RBENV is installed correctly</h2>

<p>Installing RBENV via <code>brew install rbenv</code> would be a perfectly fine option for a normal user.  But it won't work for our purposes, because it would leave us without access to RBENV's <code>.git</code> directory, and therefore its git history.  That means we couldn't roll back to the specific version of RBENV that I'll be using for this walk-through.  It's important that we work off the same codebase, so let's try another technique- installing from source.</p>

<p>To do this, we'll follow the instructions on <a href='https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/tree/e8b7a27ee67a5751b899215b4d35fd86ab552dae#basic-git-checkout' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>this version of the RBENV Readme file</a>.  First, open your terminal and check whether you already have a directory called <code>~/.rbenv</code>, by running <code>ls -la ~/.rbenv</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/.rbenv

<p>If this directory does exist, <strong>and</strong> if the command output includes a <code>.git/</code> directory in it like it does above, you should be good to go.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the output exists but looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/.rbenv

drwxr-xr-x   5 richiethomas  staff   160 Jan 10 12:56 .

drwxr-xr-x   3 richiethomas  staff    96 Jan 10 12:48 versions
$ </code></pre>

<p>Specifically, you run the <code>ls -la</code> command and you <strong>don't</strong> see a <code>.git</code> folder included in the output.</p>

<p>That likely means you previously installed RBENV using a package manager like Homebrew.  If this is the case, one option is to simply rename your <code>/.rbenv</code> directory as <code>/.rbenv-old</code> or something similar:</p>

<pre><code>$ mv ~/.rbenv/ ~/.rbenv-old</code></pre>

<p>After the old RBENV folder is renamed, we can install RBENV again via source, by following the instructions on <a href='https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/tree/e8b7a27ee67a5751b899215b4d35fd86ab552dae#basic-git-checkout' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>this version of the RBENV Readme file</a>.  Run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv

<p>Once this is done, you should have a fresh installation of RBENV inside <code>~/.rbenv</code>, which includes a <code>.git</code> directory:</p>

<h2>Ensuring your new RBENV install has your old data</h2>

<p>Next, we'll copy your currently-installed Ruby versions, gems, etc. to this new installation, ensuring that you can continue using RBENV as you did before:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp -r ~/.rbenv-old/versions \                                                                                     
> ~/.rbenv-old/version \                                                                        
> ~/.rbenv-old/shims \                                                     
> ~/.rbenv-old/rbenv.d \                                
> ~/.rbenv-old/completions \       
> ~/.rbenv
$ </code></pre>


<p>Now, the version of RBENV which you installed from source should have any and all gems, installed Ruby versions, selected Ruby version, completions, and hooks that you may have previously installed in your old RBENV version.</p>

<p>If you ever encounter version-related problems with Ruby or RBENV on your machine from now on, you can simply delete the version of RBENV that we just installed, and rename your <code>~/.rbenv-old</code> directory back to <code>~/.rbenv</code>, and you should be good-to-go.</p>

<h2>Rolling back to the correct git commit</h2>

<p>Next, let's navigate into this directory via <code>cd ~/.rbenv</code>.</p>

<p>We want to make sure that we're all looking at the same code, which means looking at the same git commit.  So we'll create a new branch, separate from your <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch, and point that branch to a specific commit, i.e. the one that I used when I started writing this guide (that commit SHA is <code>c4395e58201966d9f90c12bd6b7342e389e7a4cb</code>).</p>

<p>I called my new branch <code>impostorsguides</code>, but you can call it whatever is easiest for you to remember:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b impostorsguides
Switched to a new branch 'impostorsguides'
~/.rbenv (impostorsguides)  $ git reset --hard c4395e58201966d9f90c12bd6b7342e389e7a4cb
HEAD is now at c4395e5 Merge pull request #1418 from uraitakahito/patch-0
$ </code></pre>

<p>For future reference, the Github link to this specific version of the RBENV codebase can be found <a href='https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/tree/c4395e58201966d9f90c12bd6b7342e389e7a4cb' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>.</p>

<h2>Enabling RBENV's shell function</h2>

<p>We're getting close to the end, but we still have 2 more steps in <a href='https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/tree/e8b7a27ee67a5751b899215b4d35fd86ab552dae#basic-git-checkout' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>the installation instructions</a>.  Next we have to add some text to our shell's startup script.  This script will create a shell function called <code>rbenv</code>, which (for our purposes) will do the same job as if we were running the command from a file.</p>

<p>The RBENV Readme file tells you how to add the text to your script.  The command you'll copy/paste into your terminal depends on which shell program (bash, zsh, etc.) you're running:</p>

<blockquote>
2. Configure your shell to load rbenv:

For <strong>bash</strong>:

Ubuntu Desktop users should configure <code>~/.bashrc</code>:

<pre><code>echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

On other platforms, bash is usually configured via ~/.bash_profile:

<pre><code>echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile</code></pre>

For <strong>Zsh</strong>:

<pre><code>echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc</code></pre>

For <strong>Fish shell</strong>:

<pre><code>echo 'status --is-interactive; and ~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish</code></pre>

</blockquote>

<p>To find out which shell you're running, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $SHELL</code></pre>

<p>In my case, since I'm on a new Mac, my default terminal is Zsh:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
$</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, I'd paste the following into my terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc</code></pre>

<p>This will add the text <code>eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"</code> into a file called <code>~/.zshrc</code>, which is run every time I open a new terminal tab.  If your terminal is different from mine (for example, <code>bash</code>), the filename will be different from <code>~/.zshrc</code> (for example, <code>~/.bashrc</code>), but the gist of what's happening is still the same.</p>

<p>Lastly, in order for these changes to take effect, I'll need to do exactly that- open a new terminal tab.  When I do so, and I run <code>which rbenv</code>, I see the following shell command definition:</p>

<pre><code>$ which rbenv
rbenv () {
  local command
  command="${1:-}" 
  if [ "$#" -gt 0 ]
  then
    shift
  fi
  case "$command" in
    (rehash | shell) eval "$(rbenv "sh-$command" "$@")" ;;
    (*) command rbenv "$command" "$@" ;;
  esac
}
$</code></pre>

<p>If we see the above output, we know RBENV has been successfully installed.</p>

<h2>Generating an RBENV shim</h2>

<p>The last thing we should do is make sure our Ruby version and its associated gems will be managed by RBENV (not by the system).  To do this, we'll attempt to install a Ruby version, followed by a Ruby gem</p>

<p>Run <code>brew install ruby-build</code> to install the <code>rbenv install</code> command.  This is the program which enables RBENV to install new versions of Ruby.</p>  If it was successful, you should see something like the following:

==> Installed ruby-3.2.2 to /Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/versions/3.2.2</code></pre>

<p>Next, run <code>rbenv global 3.2.2</code> to tell RBENV to use your newly-installed Ruby version as the default global version (instead of using the version which came pre-installed on your machine):</p>

<pre><code>$ rbenv global 3.2.2
$ rbenv global
3.2.2
</code></pre>

<p>Next, run <code>gem install bundler</code> to make sure that this version of Ruby has the Bundler gem installed.</p>

<p>Lastly, run <code>which bundle</code> to make sure that the directory that appears is <code>~/.rbenv/shims/bundle</code>.  You should see something like:</p>

<pre><code> $ which bundle
/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/shims/bundle
$ </code></pre>

<p>If you see this, that means the bundle command corresponds to a shim in your RBENV directory, and you are good to go!</p>

<p>If, instead, you see something like...</p>

<pre><code> $ which bundle
/usr/bin/bundle
$ </code></pre>

<p>...this means your Bundler gem is still controlled by your system, not by RBENV.  If that's the case, verify that the <code>~/.rbenv/shims</code> folder comes before <code>/usr/bin/</code> in your <code>$PATH</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}
/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/bin
/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/shims
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/bin
/opt/homebrew/bin
/opt/homebrew/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
...
</code></pre>

<p>If it doesn't, you likely need to add the following to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file (if you're using Bash as your terminal):</p>

<pre><code>eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - bash)"
PATH="/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"</code></pre>

<p>Or if you're using Zsh (the default shell on MacOS), you'll add the following to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"
PATH="/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"</code></pre>

<p>Then open a new terminal tab and re-run which bundle.  If you still see <code>/usr/bin/bundle</code>, check the file permissions of both the <code>~/.rbenv/shims</code> folder and the shims within this folder, by running:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/.rbenv
total 80
drwxr-xr-x  18 root  staff    576 Jan 20 10:50 .
drwxr-x---+ 41 root  staff   1312 Jan 20 11:42 ..
...
drwxr-xr-x  39 root  staff   1248 Jan 20 11:16 shims
...
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/.rbenv/shims
total 296
drwxr-xr-x  39 root  staff  1248 Jan 20 11:16 .
drwxr-xr-x  18 root  staff   576 Jan 20 10:50 ..
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root  staff   409 Jan 20 11:03 bootsnap
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root  staff   409 Jan 20 11:03 bundle
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root  staff   409 Jan 20 11:03 bundler
...
</code></pre>

<p>You should see your UNIX username to the left of <code>staff</code>, <strong>not</strong> <code>root</code> (as above).  If you do in fact see <code>root</code> next to <code>staff</code>, then it's possible your directory and file permissions are preventing the shim from being executable.  In which case, verify that you cloned the RBENV repository via the <code>git clone</code> command, <strong>not</strong> <code>sudo git clone</code>.</p>

<p>After running this last step, I opened a new terminal tab and re-ran which bundle, and I finally saw my expected output: <code>/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/shims/bundle</code>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Now that we've installed RBENV and are pointing to the right version, you'll be able to replicate any experiments that we run on the RBENV code itself, such as adding log statements to the code so we can see what happens during RBENV's execution.</p>
