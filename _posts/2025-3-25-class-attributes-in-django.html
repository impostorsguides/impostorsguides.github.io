<p>While making a simple to-do app in Django as part of <a href="https://claude.ai/share/aa7c0771-5712-4ae6-887d-f8b282d9262e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a guide that ClaudeAI wrote for me</a>, I came across the following code:</p>

<pre><code>...

class TodoListView(ListView):
  model = Todo
  template_name = 'todo_app/todo_list.html'
  context_object_name = 'todos'

...</code></pre>

<p>Coming from Ruby, this code was strange-looking to me.  It looked as if we're declaring a class, and then declaring several local variables inside the class.  That's not something you'd typically do in Ruby.  Instead, you could declare class variables.</p>

<p>I assumed that's what was happening here, but I wanted to be sure.</p>
