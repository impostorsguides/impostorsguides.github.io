<p>The times when I feel impostor syndrome the least are the times when I know my set of tools inside and out.  By "tools", I mean languages, frameworks, databases, and any other component of the tech stack in front of me.  If I can predict how the will work in a given situation, teach how they work to others, and use them in new and novel ways, then my inner critic usually keeps quiet.</p>

<p>It stands to reason, then, that the more of my tools (and my team's tools) I understand, the more confident a developer I'll be.</p>

<p>That's the whole premise of my walk-through of the RBENV codebase.  I picked RBENV for the simple reason that it's the source of the first file I encountered when I asked myself one day, out of the blue, "What happens when I type <code>bundle install</code> in the terminal and hit Enter?"  At the time I was using RBENV as my version manager for Ruby.  RBENV uses shims of the various commands installed by the user, and in my case, this was one of them.</p>

<h2>Why I Picked RBENV</h2>

<p>Frankly, because it was short enough to seem like a manageable task, and long enough that I thought I'd get a lot of learning out of it.  Really not much more complicated than that.</p>

<p>I could have just as easily picked the Bundle codebase, or Rails, or even Ruby itself.  Any of those would have been a perfectly fine choice, and I'll probably move on to one of those next.  I even considered punting on RBENV and moving on to Ruby itself, since its internals are more broadly-applicable to my day job than shell scripting is.</p>
  
<p>In the end, I stuck with RBENV out of a combination of stubbornness and curiosity about how the shell worked.  I don't regret my choice, since now the output of my work (my writings) are more broadly-useful to people than if I had kept my writing Ruby-specific.</p>

<h2>Why I Read The Entire Codebase</h2>

<p>At the beginning, it was mostly because I didn't know ahead of time whether a given file was critically important to the overall working of the library.  If I read it and it's not important, I've wasted a bit of time but learned something useful (that this thing is not important).  If I skip the file and it was important, that inhibits my understanding of whichever file I <i>do</i> end up reading.</p>

<p>Then, as I learned more and more about the codebase, it became a matter of finishing what I started.  Yes I'm a bit of a completist, at least with personal projects like this.  It means more to me if I can say I read the entire codebase, vs. if I can say I read "most" of it.</p>

<p>There were some parts that I spent more time on than others, of course.  For example, I actually skipped reading and writing about <code>src/shobj-conf</code> line-by-line.  It's almost 600 lines of code long, and it wasn't written by the RBENV core team's authors, but by another developer named Chet Ramey.  It was included in RBENV as a dependency, and according to comments at the top of the file, its job is to:</p>

<blockquote>
...output a series of variable assignments to be substituted
into a Makefile by configure which specify system-dependent
information for creating shared objects that may be loaded
into bash...
</blockquote>

<p>For these reasons, covering this file as part of my project seemed like a lot of work for relatively little reward.  Anything I'd learn from it would be unrelated to my main goal of learning about RBENV.  So I skipped it.</p>

<h2>Why I Write About What I Learn</h2>

<p>To make sure I understand it.  If I can't clearly explain what something does to someone else, it's a sign I don't understand it well enough.</p>

<p>Also, because it frequently results in me learning more than I would have.  The act of writing forces me to examine my own thought process, which has the effect of prompting questions which I wouldn't have thought of via reading alone.  This takes me down a rabbit hole which usually results in a more in-depth understanding.</p>

<p>Also, to get better at technical writing, as well as writing in general.  Without publishing this stuff, I won't get feedback from other people, and that kind of criticism is a key part of becoming more anti-fragile.</p>

<p>Last but not least- in case it's helpful to someone else!  I believe that reading and writing about an open-source codebase is a great way to overcome impostor syndrome.  Again, this is doubly true if the codebase you pick is one that you (or your team) use everyday, since it'll make you a more effective team member.  But picking any codebase which is maintained by someone who knows something you don't will make you a better developer.</p>
