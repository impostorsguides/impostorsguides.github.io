<h1>Maybe a 10x engineer could read that code, but not me... üòî</h1>

<p>Have you ever thought this before?  Or any of the following?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their ability to finish a task in minutes or hours, which would take us days or weeks.</li>
  <li>"These docs are written for people who *already know* the language/framework/etc."</li>
</ul>



<p>If so, you're not alone.  I've been an engineer for 10+ years and I still catch myself thinking it.</p>

<p>I didn't come from a traditional software engineering background (CS degree, programming since I was a newborn, etc.).  I graduated from a coding bootcamp (RIP Dev Bootcamp Chicago), and software engineering is my 3rd career (previously I was a travel agent and an ESL teacher in Shanghai).</p>

<p>So it's an understatement to say that I've always felt like somewhat of an outsider in tech.</p>

<p>My bootcamp taught me how to use Ruby, Rails, MySQL, etc.  And after I got my first job, I learned how to use front-end frameworks like React.  And over time, I became halfway-decent at building things with them.  But when I opened up the Github pages for these frameworks and attempted to learn how they worked, I'd always close my laptop after about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>What kind of brain genius built these frameworks?  How do they do it?</p>

<h2>If only I could do what they do...</h2>

<p>I struggled to read not only the code itself, but even the PRs from which the code originated.</p>
  
<p>The discussions between the PR author and the core team were way over my head.  These engineers were clearly in possession of superior talent and I wanted to learn from them, but the concepts they were talking about were completely foreign to me.</p>

<p>I had no idea where to start, and it felt so overwhelming, that I ended up giving up.</p>

<h2>The day I changed course</h2>

<p>One day, in one of my semi-frequent binges of self-improvement resources, I opened up <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement" target="_blank">a post on James Clear's blog</a>, and I saw this chart:</p>

<center>
  <figure style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0 10px 25px">
    <img src="/assets/images/1-percent-better.jpg" width="80%" alt="A chart showing that, after 1 year, a 1% daily improvement results in an exponential total gain.  The reverse is also true- a 1% decline in performance results in 3% of the original performance level.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Chart recreated by me, based on the one <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement">here</a>, by James Clear.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

<p>I realized that if I could learn just one thing from those PRs per day, after a week or two I'd be able to understand what they were talking about.</p>

<p>If I could take that huge, unapproachable framework and just understand one line of code per day, after awhile I'd understand the whole file.  And with enough repetitions of that, I'd understand the whole codebase.</p>

<p>So I committed myself to doing just that.  I would become 1% better as a developer, every day.</p>

<h2>How do you build a house?  One brick at a time.</h2>

<div>
  <figure style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0 10px 25px">
    <img src="/assets/images/bricklayer.jpg" width="100%" alt="A man laying brick.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Photo attribution #2 <a href="/#photo-attribution">here</a>.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>I picked a file from the codebase, starting with the entry point into that codebase (i.e. the first file in the code's execution path).  Then I woke up an hour early every day, and read the file, starting at the first line of code.</p>

<p>Along the way, I took notes in a Google doc.  This was a critical part of the process, as it forced me to explain what I thought the code was doing, as if I were pairing with another engineer.  If I couldn't verbalize what I thought was happening, it was a sign that I didn't yet understand the code well enough.</p>

<p>At first, it was difficult.  There were so many things that I didn't know, and quite a few things that  I didn't even know I didn't know (i.e. "unknown unknowns").  But over time, I started seeing the same things over and over again.  Things I had learned the first time around.</p>

<p>As I picked up more and more bits of knowledge, reading 1 line of code per day turned into reading 1 block of code per day.  Then one file per day.  And so on.</p>

<h2>"Don't Break The Chain"</h2>

<div>
  <figure style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0 10px 25px">
    <img src="/assets/images/broken-chain.jpg" width="100%" alt="A chain with a broken link.">

<p>The key to this was consistency.  I had to be diligent about showing up every day.  For me, the inspiration for this came from comedian <a href="https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy" target="_blank">Jerry Seinfeld</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p></p>
  <p>Brad Isaac was a young comedian starting out on the comedy circuit. One fateful night, he found himself in a club where Jerry Seinfeld was performing. In an interview on Lifehacker, Isaac shared what happened when he caught Seinfeld backstage and asked if he had ‚Äúany tips for a young comic.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Here‚Äôs how Isaac described the interaction with Seinfeld...</p>
  <p>(Seinfeld) said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day.</p>

  <p>He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúAfter a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not break the chain.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's hard to overstate how motivational it was for me to look at a calendar and see a large-and-growing chain, representing the progress I was making toward my goal.</p>

<h2>What if there was another way?</h2>

<p>What if your teammates considered you the go-to expert on how your libraries work, because you know their internals so thoroughly?</p>

<p>What if you could confidently explain how the internals of a language like Ruby or Rails work, to job interviewers, teammates, and anyone else?</p>

<p>What if you never again had to worry about your team adopting a new library, because you had a repeatable process for learning the internals of any codebase you want?</p>

<p>What if you had the ability to not only read and learn from code from world-class open-source developers, but contribute to it as well, in effect becoming one of their peers?</p>

<p>Would you still feel like an impostor then?</p>
