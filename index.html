<h1>Hi, I'm Richie</h1>

<p>This site is my little corner of the web, where I document what I learn about coding.  And maybe other stuff too, still not sure yet.</p>

<div>
  <figure style="width: 40%; margin: 0 0 10px 25px; float: right;">

<p>I didn't come from a traditional software engineering background (CS degree, programming since I was a newborn, etc.).  I graduated from a coding bootcamp (R.I.P. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_Bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Bootcamp</a> Chicago ðŸ«—), and software engineering is my 3rd career (previously I was a travel agent and an ESL teacher in Shanghai).</p>

<p>So it's an understatement to say that I've always felt like somewhat of an outsider in tech.</p>

<p>Bootcamp taught me how to use Ruby, Rails, MySQL, etc.  And after I got my first job, I learned how to use front-end frameworks like React.  But when I opened up the Github pages for these frameworks and attempted to learn how they worked, the PR conversations looked like Greek to me.</p>

<p>The discussions between the PR author and the core team were way over my head.  I wanted to learn from the authors, but the concepts they were talking about were completely foreign to me.</p>

<p>I had no idea where to start, and it felt so overwhelming, that I'd frequently give up.</p>

<h2>The day I changed course</h2>

<p>One day, I happened to open <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Clear's blog</a>, and I saw this chart:</p>

<center>
  <figure style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0 10px 25px">
    <img src="/assets/images/1-percent-better.jpg" width="80%" alt="A chart showing that, after 1 year, a 1% daily improvement results in an exponential total gain.  The reverse is also true- a 1% decline in performance results in 3% of the original performance level.">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Chart recreated by me, based on the one <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement">here</a>, by James Clear.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

<p>I realized that if I could learn just one or two big new things from those PRs per day, after a week or two I'd be able to understand at least some of what they were talking about.</p>

<p>If I could take that huge, unapproachable framework and just understand one line of code per day, after awhile I'd understand an entire file.  And with enough repetitions of that, I'd understand the whole codebase.</p>

<p>That's what I committed myself to doing.  I would become 1% better as a developer, every day.</p>

<h2>How do you build a house?  One brick at a time.</h2>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>I picked a file from the codebase, starting with the entry point into that codebase (i.e. the first file in the code's execution path).  Then I woke up a little earlier every day, and read the file, starting at the first line of code.</p>

<p>Along the way, I took notes in a Google doc.  This was a critical part of the process, as it forced me to explain what I thought the code was doing, as if I were pairing with another engineer.  If I couldn't verbalize what I thought was happening, it was a sign that I didn't yet understand the code well enough.</p>

<p>There were so many things that I didn't know, and quite a few things that  I didn't even know I didn't know (i.e. "unknown unknowns").  But over time, I started seeing the same things over and over again.  Things I had learned the first time around.</p>

<p>As I picked up more and more bits of knowledge, reading 1 line of code per day turned into reading 1 block of code per day.  Then one file per day.  And so on.</p>

<h2>"Don't Break The Chain"</h2>

<div>
  <figure style="width: 100%; margin: 0 0 10px 25px">
    <img src="/assets/images/broken-chain.jpg" width="100%" alt="A chain with a broken link.">

<p>The key to this was consistency.  I had to be diligent about showing up every day.  My inspiration for this came from comedian Jerry Seinfeld:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Software developer Brad Isaac was an aspiring comedian when Jerry was still touring at the start of his Seinfeld fame. One night they happened to be at the same club. "Do you have any tips for a new comic?" Brad asked Jerry.</p>

  <p>"The way to be a better comic is to create better jokes," Jerry replied. "And the way to create better jokes is to write every day." Then Jerry shared his secret for sticking to such a schedule:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>He hung a large wall calendar in a conspicuous spot so he'd see it all the time.</li>
    <li>Next to it, he placed a colorful marker.</li>
    <li>Each day, after he completed his writing task, he put a large X in the box on the calendar associated with that day of the week.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>"After a few days you'll have a chain," Jerry explained. "Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your job is not to break the chain."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"Don't break the chain," he repeated.</p>

  <p>Source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240207033526/https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/library/newsletters/stepping-stone/2019/march/stp-iss-71-stern.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's hard to overstate how motivational it was for me to look at a calendar and see a large-and-growing chain, representing the progress I was making toward my goal.</p>
