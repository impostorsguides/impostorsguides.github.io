<h1>Maybe a 10x engineer could read that code, but not me... ðŸ˜”</h1>

<p>Have you ever thought this before?  Or any of the following?</p>

<ul>
  <!-- <li>Their ability to finish a task in minutes or hours, which would take us days or weeks.</li> -->
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k2i9ix/how_do_you_become_a_better_software_engineer/" target="_blank">"I just want to make more of an impact to my company as a software engineer."</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hkmln/how_to_fix_a_stagnant_career_as_a_software/" target="_blank">"I've had very little mentorship from senior folks..."</a></li>
  <li>"These docs are written for people who *already know* the language/framework/etc."</li>
</ul>

<p>What if, instead of thinking the above, you thought:</p>

<h2>"Oh, <i>that's</i> all this code does?!?</h2>

<p>But how do you get to that point?  What strategies are available?</p>

<h2>Learning on the job?  What if your job is the bottleneck?</h2>

<p>What if the senior engineers on your team don't have time to mentor you?</p>

<p>What if the code your team writes isn't the level of quality you aspire to?</p>

<p>What if your company tasks you with so much work that you have no time left for learning?</p>

<h2>Grinding LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.?</h2>

<p>Will the things I learn even be useful in my current / future job, or are they just parlor tricks for geeks?</p>

<p>Do I even want to work for a company which would prioritize solving these puzzles, vs. real-world skills like building applications?</p>

<h2>Go back to school / bootcamp and study CS?</h2>

<p>Can I afford to take time off work for that long?</p>

<p>Can I afford the associated cost?</p>

<p>Once I graduate, will I get help re-entering the workforce, or will I be on my own?</p>

<p>Are the skills they would teach me practical and useful, or are they all theoretical?</p>

<h2>Move to another job with better opportunities?  Easier said than done?</h2>

<p>What if you have a family to support and don't want to roll the dice on a new job?</p>

<p>What if you like your team and don't want to roll the dice on a new boss / new set of coworkers?</p>

<p>What if the economy is in a slump and the job market isn't favorable right now?</p>

<h2>Online tutorials?  Isn't the quality hit-and-miss?</h2>

<p>What if you've tried that already, and ended up in "tutorial hell"?</p>

<p>What if the only tutorials you can find are "Hello world"-style toy apps?</p>

<p>What if there are no tutorials out there for the technology you want to learn?</p>

<p>Instead, use the best "tutorial" out there- open-source code from widely-used libraries.</p>

<p>Even better, <i>contribute</i> to those libraries.  Then you can walk into a job interview and say "Do you use Library X?  Then you use code that I wrote.  I've <i>already</i> contributed to your company's codebase."</p>

<h2>Giving Up?  Accepting my situation as-is?</h2>

<p>"The other thought that has come to mind is to try not to worry about it and try and find fulfillment outside of work."</p>

<h2>Learning How To Learn</h2>

<p>Any employer who is worth their salt knows that you as a job candidate are unlikely to be 100% familiar with every component of their tech stack.  Instead, they look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reasonable familiarity with the core components of that stack, plus</li>
  <li>The ability to learn and ramp up quickly on the components you don't know.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's this meta-skill of learning-how-to-learn that's most valuable to practice.  Engineers who possess this skill don't fear applying for jobs whose requirements include new languages, frameworks, or 3rd-party tools, and they don't have a constant, low-grade fear that the next new hotness will replace the tech stack they're currently familiar with, because they know how to quickly ramp up on those things.</p>

<h2>What if there was another way?</h2>

<p>What if your teammates considered you the go-to expert on how your libraries work, because you know their internals so thoroughly?</p>

<p>What if you could arm yourself with the best practices of some of the world's best engineers, because you had analyzed their techniques in real-world codebases?</p>

<p>What if you could not only employ those techniques yourself, but teach them to your team as well?</p>

<p>What if you could confidently explain how the internals of a language like Ruby or Rails work, to job interviewers, teammates, and anyone else?</p>

<p>What if you never again had to worry about your team adopting a new library, because you had a repeatable process for learning the internals of any codebase you want?</p>

<p>What if you had the ability to not only read and learn from code from world-class open-source developers, but contribute to it as well, in effect becoming one of their peers?</p>

<p>Would you still feel like an impostor then?</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>In my walk-through of the RBENV codebase, you'll learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to read open-source code line-by-line, generating little wins which build up to big wins.</li>
  <li>How to pick one thing at a time to zero in on.</li>
  <li>The one resource you should be checking before Google, every time.</li>
  <li>What to do when Googling for a term returns no useful results.</li>
  <li>How to verify what Google tells you, via experiments.</li>
  <li>How to use Github's PR history to understand <i>why</i> the code is the way it is, and how it got that way.</li>
</ul>
