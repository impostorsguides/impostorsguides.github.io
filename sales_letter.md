That's the question which set me off on a year-long journey to learn the internals of my toolset.


When most of us start out as engineers, we're floored by the skills that we see other engineers displaying.

 - Their ability to finish a task in minutes or hours, which would take us days or weeks.
 - Their ability to receive chapter-and-verse of how the tech stack works.
 - Their ability to anticipate and overcome obstacles before they happen.

Have you ever said any of these things?

And my personal favorite:

## "Maybe a principal engineer could understand the internals of that library, but I never could."
