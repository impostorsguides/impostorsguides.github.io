Have you ever said this before?  Then you're not alone.

## What if you had a repeatable process for grokking any codebase you chose?
## What if you were the go-to expert on your team for how the internals of your framework, library, etc. worked?


What if your teammates considered you the go-to expert on how your libraries work, because you know their internals so thoroughly?

What if you could confidently explain how the internals of a language like Ruby or Rails work, to job interviewers, teammates, and anyone else?

What if you never again had to worry about your team adopting a new library, because you had a repeatable process for learning the internals of any codebase you want?

What if you had the ability to not only read and learn from code from world-class open-source developers, but contribute to it as well, in effect becoming one of their peers?

Would you still feel like an impostor then?

## How do you build a house?  One brick at a time.  
## How do you grok a codebase?  One line of code at a time.
