## This site, in 10 seconds

This is "David and Goliath" on Github.

I want to help newbie developers understand complex, widely-used open-source programs that they might otherwise be too intimidated to approach.

I have a theory that this understanding will help people who suffer from impostor syndrome feel less like impostors.  This site is an attempt to test that theory, both on them and on myself.

## Who is this site for?

Any developer who aspires to level up, but who feels like working on mission-critical open-source apps is "out of their league".  If you've ever said to yourself "Maybe an engineering manager or a staff engineer could grok that, but I'd never be able to", this site is for you.

## Who is this site *not* for?

Anyone who **doesn't** like a lot of hand-holding.  I err on the side of over-explaining things here.  If that will make you feel like I'm talking down to you, then you're probably not my target audience.

## What This Site Is About

Greybeards always tell newbies to "read the f'ing manual", but I contend that "the manual" is quite often targeted toward people who already understand the jargon of the domain (aka, they're already experts).  [Chip and Dan Heath's amazing book "Made To Stick"](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others-ebook/dp/B000N2HCKQ/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} talks about "The Curse of Knowledge" and how experts often don't realize that they're talking over the heads of more novice practicioners.  I notice this most often with older, more foundational technologies like shell scripting, so-called "hard" languages like C, etc.  This creates friction which makes it harder for newbies to level themselves up.

"The Impostor's Guide To Programming" is an attempt to fix that.  The goal of this site is to swing the pendulum in the opposite direction, erring on the side of **too much hand-holding**.  It makes the assumption that, when faced between the dual risks of annoying a more seasoned engineer vs. mystifying a more novice one, the latter is the greater sin.

Earlier I said:

> If you've ever said to yourself "Maybe an engineering manager or a staff engineer could grok that, but I'd never be able to", this site is for you.

Speaking personally, I remember saying this to myself with the Bundle and RBENV codebases, which is why I'm starting with RBENV.

## Warning

These posts represent my best understanding of the domain at the time I wrote them.  That said, I'm a journeyman engineer myself, and I guarantee you there are errors within these posts.  This project started out as an attempt to level myself up by "teaching what I've learned", and that will largely continue to be the case going forward.

"The Impostor's Guides" is a one-person operation, but its quality will go up by orders of magnitude if other people contribute.  If you spot an error and want to help fix it, feel free to reach out by email at `impostorsguides at gmail dot com` or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/impostorsguides){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if that's easier.  Feel free to use those same avenues for general questions or comments you have.

## Why the focus on Ruby and Rubyists?

I mostly work with Ruby in my day job.  I got my start in Ruby, at a bootcamp (RIP Dev Bootcamp <3).  I love the Ruby community and its MINASWAN ethos.

## What prior knowledge do you need to follow this?

 - You need to know how to use `git`.  If you don't yet know this crucial tool, a good free resource is [the "Pro Git" book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a free, comprehensive book available entirely online.
 - You need very basic knowledge of how to navigate in a terminal.  You should be familiar with `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and similarly elementary commands.
 - You need some basic programming knowledge, such as familiarity with if-blocks, case statements, what variables are, etc.

## This Site's Principles

 - The best way to learn something is to teach it.
 - If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it well enough.
 - Teaching someone to fish is better than giving them a fish.
 - Experiments help you verify something works on your own machine.
 - They're also great hands-on activities.
 - Whenever possible, use resources that are free (as in beer).  This guide is for everyone, and everyone can afford "free".

## A Note About Links

I use internet-archived links whenever possible, so you can see what I saw at the time I encountered the pages that I reference.

My first choice for these archived links is usually [The Wayback Machine](https://www.archive.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, since they don't obfuscate the links and you can see what link you'll be visiting.  Occasionally, that wasn't possible:

<center style="margin-bottom: 3em">
  <img src="/assets/images/screenshot-19mar2023-1134am.png" width="90%" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em">
</center>

In these cases, I use Archive.ph instead.  I'm looking for a back-up archiver which doesn't obfuscate links, and would appreciate any suggestions.

Also occasionally, I have no choice but to link to a Youtube video.  These links aren't archivable, as far as I know, so I link to the original and pray that the video stays up forever.
