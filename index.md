Have you ever said this before?  Then you're not alone.

## What if you had a repeatable process for grokking any codebase you chose?
## What if you were the go-to expert on your team for how the internals of your framework, library, etc. worked?


What if you knew the internals of your most commonly-used open-source tools (Rails, Ruby, MySQL, etc.) so well that you could write your team's code accordingly?

Even better, what if you didn't have to worry about your tools becoming obsolete in the face of the next new thing, because you had a repeatable process for learning those tools too?

## How do you grok a codebase?  One line of code at a time.
