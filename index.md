# What This Site Is About

The programming community could stand to be a more welcoming place for beginners.  Greybeards always tell newbies to "read the fucking manual", but "the manual" is quite often written for people who were already experts, or at least appears that way to those same newbies.

"The Impostor's Guide To Programming" is an attempt to fix that.  [Chip and Dan Heath's amazing book "Made To Stick"](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others-ebook/dp/B000N2HCKQ/) talks about "The Curse of Knowledge" and how experts often don't realize that they're talking over the heads of more novice practicioners.  This site attempts to swing the pendulum in the opposite direction, erring on the side of too much hand-holding.  It makes the assumption that, when faced between the dual risks of annoying a more seasoned engineer vs. mystifying a more novice one, the latter is the greater sin.

I'm a journeyman engineer myself, and I may have gotten some things wrong in these posts.  If you spot an error and want to help fix it, feel free to reach out [here](https://twitter.com/impostorsguides) (for now).  You can also use the same link to reach out with general questions or comments.

## This Site's Principles

 - The best way to learn something is to teach it.
 - If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it well enough.
 - Teaching someone to fish is better than giving them a fish.
 - Experiments help you verify something works on your own machine.
 - They're also great hands-on activities.
