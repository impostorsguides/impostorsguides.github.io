# This site, in 10 seconds

This is "David and Goliath" on Github.

I want to help newbie developers grok complex, widely-used open-source programs that they might otherwise be too intimidated to approach.

# Who is this site for?

Any developer who aspires to level up, but who feels like working on mission-critical open-source apps is "out of their league".  If you've ever said to yourself "I'd never be able to understand (codebase XYZ), only rockstar 10x ninjas* can grok that", this site is for you.

\* do people still talk like that?

# Who is this site *not* for?

Anyone who **doesn't** like a lot of hand-holding.  I err on the side of over-explaining things here.  If that will make you feel like I'm talking down to you, then you're probably not my target audience.

# What This Site Is About

The programming community could stand to be a more welcoming place for beginners.  Greybeards always tell newbies to "read the fucking manual", but "the manual" is quite often written for people who are already experts, or at least it appears written that way to those same newbies.

"The Impostor's Guide To Programming" is an attempt to fix that.  [Chip and Dan Heath's amazing book "Made To Stick"](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others-ebook/dp/B000N2HCKQ/) talks about "The Curse of Knowledge" and how experts often don't realize that they're talking over the heads of more novice practicioners.  This site attempts to swing the pendulum in the opposite direction, erring on the side of too much hand-holding.  It makes the assumption that, when faced between the dual risks of annoying a more seasoned engineer vs. mystifying a more novice one, the latter is the greater sin.

I'm a journeyman engineer myself, and I may have gotten some things wrong in these posts.  If you spot an error and want to help fix it, feel free to reach out [here](https://twitter.com/impostorsguides) (for now).  You can also use the same link to reach out with general questions or comments.

# Why the focus on Ruby and Rubyists?  Are you saying Rubyists are impostors?

*Absolutely not*.  I mostly work with Ruby in my day job.  I got my start in Ruby, at a bootcamp (RIP Dev Bootcamp <3).  I love the Ruby community and its MINASWAN ethos.  I'm not implying anything about Rubyists or their skill level.

Simply put, Ruby is the language I love and choose to work in.

# What prior knowledge do you need to follow this?

 - You need to know how to use `git`.  If you don't yet know this crucial tool, a good free resource is [the "Pro Git" book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), a free, comprehensive book available entirely online.
 - You need very basic knowledge of how to navigate in a terminal.  You should be familiar with `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and similarly elementary commands.
 - You need some basic programming knowledge, such as familiarity with if-blocks, case statements, what variables are, etc.

# This Site's Principles

 - The best way to learn something is to teach it.
 - If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it well enough.
 - Teaching someone to fish is better than giving them a fish.
 - Experiments help you verify something works on your own machine.
 - They're also great hands-on activities.
 - Whenever possible, use resources that are free (as in beer).  This guide is for everyone, and everyone can afford "free".

# A Note About Links

I use internet-archived links whenever possible, so you can see what I saw at the time I encountered the pages that I reference.

My first choice for these archived links is usually [The Wayback Machine](https://www.archive.org/), since they don't obfuscate the links and you can see what link you'll be visiting.  Occasionally, that wasn't possible:

<center style="margin-bottom: 3em">
  <img src="/assets/images/screenshot-19mar2023-1134am.png" width="90%" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em">
</center>

In these cases, I use Archive.ph instead.  I'm looking for a back-up archiver which doesn't obfuscate links, and would appreciate any suggestions.
