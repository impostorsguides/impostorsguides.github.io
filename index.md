## Who is this site for?

Any developer who aspires to level up, but who feels like working on mission-critical open-source apps is "out of their league".  If you've ever said to yourself "Maybe an engineering manager or a staff engineer could grok that, but I'd never be able to", this site is for you.

## Warning

These posts represent my best understanding of the domain at the time I wrote them.  That said, I'm a journeyman engineer myself, and I guarantee you there are errors within these posts.  This project started out as an attempt to level myself up by "teaching what I've learned", and that will continue to be the case going forward.

"The Impostor's Guides" is a one-person operation, but its quality will go up by orders of magnitude if other people contribute.  If you spot an error and want to help fix it, feel free to reach out by email at `impostorsguides [at] gmail "dot" com`.

## Why the focus on Ruby and Rubyists?

I mostly work with Ruby in my day job.  I got my start in Ruby, at a bootcamp (RIP Dev Bootcamp <3).  I love the Ruby community and its MINASWAN ethos.

## What prior knowledge do you need to follow this?

 - You need to know how to use `git`.  If you don't yet know this crucial tool, a good free resource is [the "Pro Git" book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a free, comprehensive book available entirely online.
 - You need very basic knowledge of how to navigate in a terminal.  You should be familiar with `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and similarly elementary commands.
 - You need some basic programming knowledge, such as familiarity with if-blocks, case statements, what variables are, etc.

## This Site's Principles

 - The best way to learn something is to teach it.
 - If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it well enough.
 - Teaching someone to fish is better than giving them a fish.
 - Experiments help you verify something works on your own machine.
 - They're also great hands-on activities.
 - Whenever possible, use resources that are free (as in beer).  This guide is for everyone, and everyone can afford "free".

## A Note About Links

I use internet-archived links whenever possible, so you can see what I saw at the time I encountered the pages that I reference.

My first choice for these archived links is usually [The Wayback Machine](https://www.archive.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, since they don't obfuscate the links and you can see what link you'll be visiting.  Occasionally, specific URLs get excluded from Wayback, and in these cases, I use Archive.ph instead.  I'm looking for a back-up archiver which doesn't obfuscate links, and would appreciate any suggestions.

Also occasionally, I have no choice but to link to a Youtube video.  These links aren't archivable, as far as I know, so I link to the original and pray that the video stays up forever.
