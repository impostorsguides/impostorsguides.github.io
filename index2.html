<h1>Maybe a 10x engineer could read that code, but not me... ðŸ˜”</h1>

<p>Have you ever thought this before?  Or any of the following?</p>

<ul>
  <!-- <li>Their ability to finish a task in minutes or hours, which would take us days or weeks.</li> -->
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k2i9ix/how_do_you_become_a_better_software_engineer/" target="_blank">"I just want to make more of an impact to my company as a software engineer, moreso than to get a higher salary or to grind Leetcode to get into a top tech company."</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4hkmln/how_to_fix_a_stagnant_career_as_a_software/" target="_blank">"The coding and practices (at my company) are... poor and I've had very little mentorship from senior folks..."</a></li>
  <li>"These docs are written for people who *already know* the language/framework/etc."</li>
</ul>

<h2>What if there was another way?</h2>

<p>What if your teammates considered you the go-to expert on how your libraries work, because you know their internals so thoroughly?</p>

<p>What if you could arm yourself with the best practices of some of the world's best engineers, because you had analyzed their techniques in real-world codebases?</p>

<p>What if you could not only employ those techniques yourself, but teach them to your team as well?</p>

<p>What if you could confidently explain how the internals of a language like Ruby or Rails work, to job interviewers, teammates, and anyone else?</p>

<p>What if you never again had to worry about your team adopting a new library, because you had a repeatable process for learning the internals of any codebase you want?</p>

<p>What if you had the ability to not only read and learn from code from world-class open-source developers, but contribute to it as well, in effect becoming one of their peers?</p>

<p>Would you still feel like an impostor then?</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>In my walk-through of the RBENV codebase, you'll learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to read open-source code line-by-line, generating little wins which build up to big wins.</li>
  <li>How to pick one thing at a time to zero in on.</li>
  <li>The one resource you should be checking before Google, every time.</li>
  <li>What to do when Googling for a term returns no useful results.</li>
  <li>How to verify what Google tells you, via experiments.</li>
  <li>How to use Github's PR history to understand <i>why</i> the code is the way it is, and how it got that way.</li>
</ul>
