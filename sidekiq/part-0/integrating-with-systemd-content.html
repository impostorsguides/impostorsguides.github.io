<p>Next line of code:</p>

<pre><code>require_relative "../lib/sidekiq/cli"</code></pre>

<p>This code simply requires the <code>Sidekiq::CLI</code> class, which we'll discuss in a future post.  In brief, this class is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, configuring Sidekiq, handling signals, and starting the Sidekiq process.</p>

<h2>The <code>integrate_with_systemd</code> method</h2>

<p>Next block of code:</p>

<pre><code>def integrate_with_systemd
  return unless ENV["NOTIFY_SOCKET"]

  Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
    config.logger.info "Enabling systemd notification integration"
    require "sidekiq/sd_notify"
    config.on(:startup) do
      Sidekiq::SdNotify.ready
    end
    config.on(:shutdown) do
      Sidekiq::SdNotify.stopping
    end
    Sidekiq.start_watchdog if Sidekiq::SdNotify.watchdog?

<p>We'll need the rest of this post to talk about what this method does.  But first: what is the "systemd" that is referenced in this method name?</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to experiment with <code>systemd</code> and its command line interface, <code>systemctl</code>, but I use a Macbook (which runs on Unix) and apparently Unix doesn't support <code>systemd</code>.  I </p>
