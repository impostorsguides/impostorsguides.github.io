In this section, we learned about:

- Github Workflows and the YAML syntax they use:
  - Establishing a workflow's metadata via directives like `name`, `on`, `push`, `release`, `tags`, etc.
  - Making one or more jobs for the workflow with the `jobs` directive
  - Establishing when your job runs, using the `runs-on` directive
  - What a matrix strategy is, and how to build one using the `strategy` and `matrix` directives
  - Establishing what steps your job takes, using the `steps` directive
  - Using pre-written steps, written by you or others, via the `uses` directive
  - Running arbitrary shell code in a step using the `run` directive
  - Passing environment variables to a step using the `env` keyword
  - Running a step only when certain conditions are met, using the `if` directive
  - Passing arguments to a step using the `with` directive
- What the difference between the `bin/` and `libexec/` directories are for, according to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
- Testing whether a shell option is turned on via the `[[ -o <optionanme> ]]` syntax
- How to test the type of a variable using parameter expansion, coupled with the `(t)` parameter
- How to generate completions for a command in `zsh`, using `compctl -K`
- How to generate completions for a command in `bash`, using `complete -F`
- What a `bindir` or `bin_dir` is
- How RBENV automatically re-generates its shims when a gem is installed or uninstalled, using the RubyGems hooks ecosystem.
- Why you might use a delimiter other than `/` when using `sed` to search-and-replace.
