Next lines of code:

```
if [ "$shell" != "fish" ]; then
...
fi
```

Here we just check whether our user's shell is "fish".  If it's not, we execute the code inside the `if` block.

Next lines of code:

```
IFS="|"
cat <<EOS
...
EOS
```

Here we set the `IFS` variable (which stands for "internal field separator") to the pipe symbol "\|".  [We've covered this before](https://web.archive.org/web/20220715010436/https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ifs-shell-variable){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but `IFS` is a special shell variable that determines how bash separates a string of characters into multiple strings.  For example, let's say we have a string `a|b|c|d|e`.  If `IFS` is set to the pipe character (as above), and if we pass our single string to a `for` loop, then bash will internally split our string into 5 strings ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e') and iterate over each of them.

The `cat << EOS` line of code starts a new heredoc, so that we can finish implementing our `rbenv` function.

Next lines of code:

```
command="\${1:-}"
```
The `\` character is just used to tell bash not to interpret the `$` character as a call to execute the parameter expansion here.  By the time this line is resolved by the `eval` statement, it will appear as:

```
command="${1:-}"
```
Since the `$` is no longer escaped with a `\` inside the `eval` statement, `eval` will perform the parameter expansion at runtime.

Speaking of that parameter expansion, I know that's what this is, and I am almost positive that it has something to do with the first argument provided to the script (hence the `1`).  But I don't recognize the `:-` syntax or what it does.  Referring to the GNU docs and searching for `:-`, I find the following:

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/images/screenshot-13mar2023-854am.png" width="90%" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em">
</p>

The docs go on to show multiple variations of the `:-` syntax, however all of them contain something after the hyphen character.  None of them end in `:-` the way that our code does.  We'll have to do some experiments to see for sure what this does.

I write the following simple script:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

command="${1:-}"

echo "$command"
```

I `chmod` it and run it, both with and without arguments:

```
$ ./foo

$ ./foo bar baz buzz

bar
```

It looks like we did indeed capture the first argument.  And if there is no first argument, the variable is empty.

I decide to do a bit more Googling since I'm still not confident that I understand all the possible edge cases that I could test here.  I find [this StackExchange post](https://web.archive.org/web/20220531142657/https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/338146/bash-defining-variables-with-var-number-default){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which seems to say the same thing that the GNU docs said:

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/images/screenshot-13mar2023-856am.png" width="90%" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em">
</p>

That said, I think the way that the StackExchange post phrases the information is more friendly to beginners like me.  Moral of the story- sometimes I need to read the same information phrased in multiple ways before I can feel confident that I understand it.

I now know another edge case I can test- what if we were to provide a default value after the `:-` syntax?  Would that work as we expect?

Here's the new script, with a default value of `foo` for the first argument:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

command="${1:-foo}"

echo "$command"
```

And here's what happens when we call the script, again both with and without arguments:

```
$ ./foo

foo

$ ./foo bar baz buzz

bar
```

So the script continues to print the first argument if there is one, but if there isn't, it defaults the value to `foo`.  Cool!  That means our script populates the `command` variable with the first argument, but does not supply a default value of no argument is specified.

With this line of code, our in-progress heredoc string containing our rbenv function looks like this:

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/images/screenshot-13mar2023-858am.png" width="70%" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em">
</p>

As you can see, we've *opened* (but not yet closed) the implementation of our `rbenv()` function.

(stopping here for the day; 28162 words; today I added a lot of writing prior to the previous day's stopping point)

Next lines of code:

```
  if [ "\$#" -gt 0 ]; then
    shift
  fi
```

If we recall, "$#" is shorthand for the number of arguments passed to the script.  So what this says is that, if the number of arguments is greater than zero, shift the first one off of the argument stack.  Again, the `\` escapes the `$` sign so that our currently-running shell doesn't resolve the `$#` symbol immediately, but instead lets the `eval` caller do so.

Next lines of code:

```
  case "\$command" in
  ${commands[*]})
    eval "\$(rbenv "sh-\$command" "\$@")";;
  *)
    command rbenv "\$command" "\$@";;
  esac
}
```

This block of code is short and familiar enough that we can analyze it all at once.  We create a `case` statement which branches depending on the value of the `command` that the user entered.

Recall that the value of the `commands` variable was set to `commands=(`rbenv-commands --sh`)`.  Therefore, if the user's command is present in the return value of `rbenv-commands --sh` (i.e. if it's equal to either `rehash` or `shell`), then we re-run the *shell function* version of `rbenv`, but this time pre-pending `sh-` to it.  If not, we use the `command` shell program to skip the `rbenv` function and go directly to the `rbenv` script inside `libexec`, passing the command to that script along with any other arguments the user included.

And with that, we've reached the end of the `rbenv-init` file!
