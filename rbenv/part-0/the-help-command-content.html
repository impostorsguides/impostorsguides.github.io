  <h1 class="post-title">The <code>help</code> Command</h1>
</header>

<p>This next chapter is a bit tricky, if you're using the Zsh shell (like I am).  For those of you who aren't using Zsh, feel free to skip to this chapter.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Up until 2019, the default shell for Macs was Bash.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230925065323/https://macpaw.com/how-to/default-interactive-shell-now-zsh" target="_blank">When Apple released macOS Catalina</a>, Apple started shipping Zsh as the default shell instead:</p>

<blockquote>
For many years following the launch of the first version of Mac OS X, the default shell in Terminal was the Bourne shell, also known as bash. In macOS Catalina, the default changed to the Z shell, also known as zsh.
</blockquote>

<p>This was possibly done because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230923201322/https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250722978" target="_blank">Bash changed its software license from GPL2 to GPL3</a>.  The difference between the two is that GPL3 requires that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230922222429/https://blog.inedo.com/devops/license-detection/" target="_blank">"code built with GPL3-licensed packages must open-source that code"</a>.  This is likely not something that Apple's business model would survive.  As a result, we as Mac users now have to spend a few mental cycles on the subtle but sometimes important differences between Bash and Zsh.</p>

<h2><code>help</code> in Bash vs. Zsh</h2>

<p>One of those differences is with the <code>help</code> command, which comes standard with Bash but which is not recognized by Zsh.  Unless we've already aliased <code>help</code> to some other command in our Zsh config file, when we type <code>help set</code> in the default Zsh terminal, we see the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ help set
zsh: command not found: help
$ </code></pre>

<p>However, if we open up Bash and type <code>help set</code>, we see the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ bash

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.

bash-3.2$ help set
set: set [--abefhkmnptuvxBCHP] [-o option] [arg ...]
        -a  Mark variables which are modified or created for export.
        -b  Notify of job termination immediately.
        -e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
        -f  Disable file name generation (globbing).
        -h  Remember the location of commands as they are looked up.
        -k  All assignment arguments are placed in the environment for a
            command, not just those that precede the command name.
        -m  Job control is enabled.
        -n  Read commands but do not execute them.
        -o option-name
            Set the variable corresponding to option-name:
                allexport    same as -a
                braceexpand  same as -B
                emacs        use an emacs-style line editing interface
                errexit      same as -e
                errtrace     same as -E
                functrace    same as -T
                hashall      same as -h
                histexpand   same as -H

              ...</code></pre>

<p>This isn't quite as readable as a <code>man</code> entry (at least, in my opinion), but at least it mentions the command we specified, instead of just telling us what a builtin is.</p>
              
<p>As it turns out, Zsh <strong>does</strong> have a <code>run-help</code> command, but it isn't turned on by default.  Instead, for some reason it's simply aliased to the <code>man</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ which run-help
run-help: aliased to man
$ </code></pre>
      
<p>If you were to type <code>run-help set</code>, you'd see the same "BUILTIN" page that we saw when running <code>man set</code>.</p>

<p>However, a real, non-aliased <code>run-help</code> does exist.  We just have to activate it ourselves.  But should we in fact do that?</p>

<h2>Getting unblocked with the <code>help</code> command</h2>

<p>To continue making progress and run <code>help set</code> successfully, we have 3 options:</p>
      
<ol>
  <li>Change our default shell from Zsh to Bash, so that every time we open a new terminal tab, we see a Bash prompt.  This is a completely valid option- Bash is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240110123203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)#Program_name" target="_blank">"the de facto default shell program in most Linux and Unix operating systems"</a>.</li>
  <li>Activate the <code>run-help</code> command on our machine, and then create an alias which executes that command every time we type <code>help</code> in our terminal.  This is the option that I chose for my machine, since I've already customized my Zsh prompt and I don't want to have to do so again with a Bash prompt.</li>
  <li>Make no permanent changes, and instead simply remember to log into Bash each time we want to run <code>help</code>.  This is the option that I feel I have to recommend to readers if I want to be a responsible author and not cause disruptions on your machine, but it's also the option which results in the most legwork in the long run.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll briefly go over the first two options below.  Hopefully the third option doesn't require any explanation- you literally just run the <code>bash</code> command in your Zsh terminal, and then run <code>help</code> at your newly-opened Bash prompt.</p>

<h2>Option 1: Changing the default shell to Bash</h2>

<p>The first option we have is to simply switch our default shell to Bash.  We can do this by entering the following command in our shell:</p>

<pre><code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code></pre>

<p>According to its <code>man</code> entry, the <code>chsh</code>, <code>chpass</code>, and <code>chfn</code> commands all do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>NAME
chpass, chfn, chsh – add or change user database information

SYNOPSIS
chpass [-l location] [-u authname] [-s newshell] [user]

DESCRIPTION
The chpass utility allows editing of the user database information associated with user or, by default, the current user.

The chpass utility cannot change the user's password on Open Directory systems.  Use the passwd(1) utility instead.

The chfn and chsh utilities behave identically to chpass.  (There is only one program.)

The information is formatted and supplied to an editor for changes.

Only the information that the user is allowed to change is displayed.

The options are as follows:

-l location    If not specified, chpass will perform a search for the user record on all available Open Directory nodes.  When specified, chpass will edit the user record on the directory node at the given location.

-u authname    The user name to use when authenticating to the directory node containing the user.

-s newshell    Attempt to change the user's shell to newshell.

...</code></pre>

<p>So this command "add(s) or change(s) user database information".  At the bottom of the output, we see that the <code>-s</code> flag "(a)ttempt(s) to change the user's shell to newshell."  Pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>When we run this command in our terminal tab and then open a new shell, we should see a Bash prompt.  On my machine, I see:</p>

<pre><code>Last login: Fri Jan 12 12:02:51 on ttys012

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.
richies-mbp:part-0 richiethomas$ </code></pre>

<p>This is the Bash prompt as it appears on my machine.</p>

<p>And if we want to change our default shell back to Zsh, we simply run the command again, with <code>/bin/zsh</code> (or the location of Zsh on your machine) as a parameter instead of <code>/bin/bash</code>.  To find the correct location to use as a param, run <code>which zsh</code>.</p>

<h2>Option 2: Aliasing <code>run-help</code> to <code>help</code></h2>

<p>As mentioned before, we could just remember to log into Bash whenever we need to run <code>help</code>.  But speaking for myself, I don't want to have to do this every single time I open a terminal tab (which is every day).  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job" target="_blank">I'm lazy</a>, and I'd rather make a one-and-done configuration change, and continue to use Zsh as I have done so far.</p>

<p>After some Googling around, I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230805163147/https://superuser.com/questions/1563825/is-there-a-zsh-equivalent-to-the-bash-help-builtin/1563859" target="_blank">this StackOverflow question</a>, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230805163147/https://superuser.com/questions/1563825/is-there-a-zsh-equivalent-to-the-bash-help-builtin/1563859#1563859" target="_blank">this answer</a> describing how to make the <code>help</code> output more... helpful (pun intended):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As indicated in the Stack Overflow question in @DavidPostill's comment, put this into ~/.zshrc:</p>

<pre><code>unalias run-help
autoload run-help
HELPDIR=/usr/share/zsh/"${ZSH_VERSION}"/help
alias help=run-help
</code></pre>

<p>If you're on macOS and installed using Homebrew, then you will want to replace the HELPDIR line with this:</p>

<pre><code>HELPDIR=$(command brew --prefix)/share/zsh/help</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's telling me to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230405124404/https://ss64.com/osx/alias-zsh.html" target="_blank">unalias</a> the current definition of the <code>run-help</code> command (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230403130053/https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zsh" target="_blank">which is aliased to <code>man</code> by default in Zsh</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/63661686/2143275" target="_blank">autoload</a> a new implementation of the <code>run-help</code> command (this is what I meant by "manually turn on the <code>run-help</code> command” from earlier)</li>
  <li>set a new value for <code>$HELPDIR</code> (This environment variable tells run-help where to look for its help files.)</li>
  <li>create an alias for our new <code>run-help</code> command, called <code>help</code>, which is just shorter and easier to type.</li>
</ol>

<p>This all sounds fine, except the very last step related to <code>$HELPDIR</code>.  I tried <code>HELPDIR=$(command brew --prefix)/share/zsh/help</code> instead of <code>HELPDIR=/usr/share/zsh/"${ZSH_VERSION}"/help</code>, but this resulted in me seeing unexpected output when typing <code>help set</code> (specifically, the <code>man</code> entry for something called <code>zshbuiltins</code>, which is not what I wanted).  So I kept the original value of <code>HELPDIR</code> mentioned in the first block of code, and that resulted in me seeing this:</p>

<pre><code>set [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o [ option_name ] ] ... [ {+|-}A [ name ] ]
[ arg ... ]
    Set the options for the shell and/or set the positional 
    parameters, or declare and set an array.  If the -s option 
    is given, it  causes the specified arguments to be sorted 
    before assigning them to the positional parameters (or to 
    the array name if -A isused).  With +s sort arguments in 
    descending order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see 
    zshoptions(1).  Flags  may be specified by name using the 
    -o option. If no option name is supplied with -o, the current 
    option states are printed: see the description of setopt 
    below for more information on the format.  With +o they are 
    printed in a form that can be used as input to the shell.
  
...</code></pre>
  
<p>This is the output we want.  Note that I had to either open a new terminal tab or run <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in order for this change to take effect.</p>

<h2>What is an <code>rc</code> dotfile?</h2>

<p>When you open a new terminal tab or window in Zsh, one of the first things that happens is that Zsh runs a few setup scripts. One of these setup scripts is called <code>~/.zshrc</code>.  This file is where you'd put configuration options that you'd want to run on every new terminal tab or window. This includes our <code>help</code> configuration, so that's why we add that code in <code>~/.zshrc</code>.</p>

<p>There are other setup scripts which get loaded as well, such as <code>~/.zshenv</code>.  But <code>~/.zshrc</code> is the one I interact with most.  Zsh will run these scripts in a specific order, and there are conventions around what you should put in each file.</p>

<p>Other shells have similar <code>rc</code> files (ex.- Bash has <code>~/.bashrc</code>). The <code>rc</code> in <code>~/.zshrc</code> stands for "run commands" or "run control", depending on who you ask.</p>
