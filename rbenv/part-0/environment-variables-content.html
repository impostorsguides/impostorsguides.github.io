<pre><code>export RBENV_DIR="${arg%/*}"
break</code></pre>

<p>If our case statement matches, <strong>and</strong> if our argument corresponds to a filepath with a "/" inside it, we set the <code>RBENV_DIR</code> environment variable.  We then <code>break</code> out of the <code>for</code> loop we're in, implying our shim doesn't need to process any more command line arguments.  But what does <code>RBENV_DIR</code> do?</p>

<h2>Searching for usages of <code>RBENV_DIR</code></h2>

<p>To answer this question, I search for it in the RBENV codebase, which (on my machine) is located at <code>~/.rbenv/</code>.</p>

<p>Note that I performed the search below using the <code>ag</code> command, which you can learn how to install <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher" target="_blank">here</a>. Your computer will likely ship with the <code>grep</code> command, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39689604/why-is-ag-slower-than-grep#:~:text=Ag%20is%20designed%20for%20searching,tools%20meant%20for%20different%20purposes." target="_blank"><code>ag</code> is <i>much</i> faster for searching codebases</a>.</p>

<p>When I run this search, I see multiple references to it in various files:</p>

<pre><code>$ ag RBENV_DIR
test/test_helper.bash
2:unset RBENV_DIR

test/local.bats
29:@test "ignores RBENV_DIR" {
33:  RBENV_DIR="$HOME" run rbenv-local

41:@test "invalid RBENV_DIR" {
44:  RBENV_DIR="$dir" run rbenv echo RBENV_DIR

test/version-file.bats

libexec/rbenv
61:if [ -z "${RBENV_DIR}" ]; then
62:  RBENV_DIR="$PWD"
64:  [[ $RBENV_DIR == /* ]] || RBENV_DIR="$PWD/$RBENV_DIR"
65:  cd "$RBENV_DIR" 2>/dev/null || abort "cannot change working directory to \`$RBENV_DIR'"
66:  RBENV_DIR="$PWD"
69:export RBENV_DIR

README.md
515:`RBENV_DIR` | `$PWD` | Directory to start searching for `.ruby-version` files.
$ </code></pre>

<p>The reference that catches my eye is the one at the bottom, in the <code>README.md</code> file. This file will likely tell us in plain English what we want to know.</p>

<p>Sure enough, we find that it contains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230413141208/https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#environment-variables" target="_blank">the following table</a>:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>default</th>
    <th>description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RBENV_DIR</td>
    <td>$PWD</td>
    <td>Directory to start searching for .ruby-version files.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Again from reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230413141208/https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv" target="_blank">the README file</a>, we see that the <code>.ruby-version</code> file is one way that RBENV uses to detect which Ruby version you want to use:</p>

<blockquote><p>"...rbenv scans the current project directory for a file named .ruby-version. If found, that file determines the version of Ruby that should be used within that directory."</p></blockquote>

<p>So here we're setting the <code>RBENV_DIR</code> variable, in order to tell RBENV where it can find the <code>.ruby-version</code> file.</p>

<p>But what is the <code>export</code> keyword at the start of <code>export RBENV_DIR="${arg%/*}"</code>?</p>

<h2><code>export</code> statements</h2>

<p>We've already seen an example of how variables are assigned in Bash, i.e. <code>program="${0##*/}"</code>. An assignment statement like <code>export FOO='bar'</code> is similar, in that creates a variable named <code>FOO</code> and sets its value to "bar", but the use of <code>export</code> means it's doing something else as well.</p>

<p>What does <code>export FOO='bar'</code> do that <code>FOO='bar'</code> doesn't do?</p>

<p>It turns out there are two kinds of variables in a Bash script:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shell variables</li>
  <li>environment variables</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding <code>export</code> in front of an assignment statement is what transforms a shell variable assignment into an environment variable assignment.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is that shell variables are only accessible from within the shell they're created in.  Environment variables, on the other hand, are also accessible from within child shells created by the parent shell.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713174024/https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-variables-export" target="_blank">This blog post</a> gives two examples, one demonstrating access of an environment variable from a child shell, and the other of (attempting to) access a shell variable from a child shell. To see this for ourselves, we can do an experiment mimicking these examples in our terminal.</p>

<h2>Experiment- environment vs shell variables</h2>

<p>We can type the following directly in our terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ export MYVAR1="Here is my environment variable"
$ MYVAR2="Here is my shell variable"
$ echo $MYVAR1
Here is my environment variable
$ echo $MYVAR2
Here is my shell variable
$ </code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. Both the shell variable and the environment variable printed successfully.</p>

<p>Now we open up a new shell from within our current terminal tab, and try again:</p>

<pre><code>$ bash

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.

bash-3.2$ echo $MYVAR1

Here is my environment variable

bash-3.2$ echo $MYVAR2

bash-3.2$ </code></pre>

<p>We can see here that <code>MYVAR1</code> is visible from within our new child shell, but <code>MYVAR2</code> is not. That's because the declaration of <code>MYVAR1</code> was prefaced with <code>export</code>, while the declaration of <code>MYVAR2</code> was not.</p>

<p>So our current line of code creates an environment variable called <code>RBENV_DIR</code>, which will be available in child shells. This implies that we'll be creating a child shell soon. What will that child shell do?</p>

<p>We'll need quite a few more chapters to fully explain the answer, but the short answer is that this shim will launch the <code>rbenv</code> command inside a child shell, wherein the environment variable will be used by RBENV to detect which Ruby version is the right one.  Then we execute the original command corresponding to the shim that's being executed (i.e. <code>bundle</code> or whatever).</p>

<h2>Setting the <code>RBENV_DIR</code> variable</h2>

<p>In the meantime, what do the contents of the <code>RBENV_DIR</code> variable look like? To answer that, we have to know what <code>"${arg%/*}"</code> resolves to, in <a href="https://gist.github.com/impostorsguides/bec6a1c0f520f703c6db259a472596c4#file-bundle-shim-L12" target="_blank">this line of code</a>.  It looks like more parameter expansion, but the <code>%/*</code> syntax looks new.  Let's run an experiment to find out what it does.</p>

<h3>Experiment- a simpler version of RBENV's parameter expansion</h3>

<p>I replace my <code>foo</code> script with the following:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

myArg="/foo/bar/baz"
bar="${myArg%/*}"
echo $bar</code></pre>

<p>When I run the script, I get:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./foo
/foo/bar
$</code></pre>

<p>So <code>${arg%/*}</code> takes the argument, and trims off the last <code>/</code> character and everything after it.</p>

<p>This aligns with what we see if we look up the GNU docs:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>${parameter##word}</strong></p>

<p>The word is expanded to produce a pattern and matched according to the rules described below (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220816200045/https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html" target="_blank">Pattern Matching</a>). <u>If the pattern matches the beginning of the expanded value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the <code>#</code> case) or the longest matching pattern (the <code>##</code> case) deleted.</u></p></blockquote>

<p>We now know enough to piece together what this line of code is doing.  We create a new environment variable named <code>RBENV_DIR</code> which will be available in any child shells.  Then, we take the directory of the file that was passed to the <code>ruby</code> command, and set <code>RBENV_DIR</code> equal to <i>the directory containing that Ruby file</i>.</p>

<h2>A quick note- single- and double-quotes</h2>

<p>When working with environment variables, it's a good idea to wrap them in double (<strong>not</strong> single) quotation marks.  That's because sometimes the value stored in an environment variable can contain spaces.</p>

<p>If double-quotes are not used, the shell may treat the multiple words inside the variable's value as multiple arguments, instead of a single argument.  And if single-quotes are used, the shell will treat <code>$FOO</code> as the string "$FOO" instead of as a variable containing a value.</p>

<h2>Summarizing the <code>if</code>-block</h2>

<p>While we're at it, let's summarize what we've learned about the <code>if</code> block inside the shim:</p>

<pre><code>if [ "$program" = "ruby" ]; then
  for arg; do
    case "$arg" in
    -e* | -- ) break ;;
    */* )
      if [ -f "$arg" ]; then
        export RBENV_DIR="${arg%/*}"
        break
      fi
      ;;
    esac
  done
fi</code></pre>

<p>Putting together everything we've learned:</p>

<p>RBENV first checks whether the command you're running is the <code>ruby</code> command.  If it's not, we skip the <code>for</code> loop entirely.</p>

<p>If it is, RBENV will iterate over each of the arguments you passed to <code>ruby</code>, checking its value.  If the arg is <code>--</code> or if it starts with <code>-e</code>, it will immediately stop checking the remaining args, and proceed to running the code outside the case statement (what that code does is TBD).</p>

<p>If the argument contains a "/" character, RBENV will check to see if that argument corresponds to a valid filepath.  If it does, the shim will store the file's parent directory in an environment variable called <code>RBENV_DIR</code>.</p>

<p>At some future place in the code, RBENV will use this environment variable to decide which Ruby version to use.</p>

<h2>Setting <code>RBENV_ROOT</code></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/impostorsguides/bec6a1c0f520f703c6db259a472596c4#file-bundle-shim-L20" target="_blank">next line of code</a> is pretty straight-forward, so we'll quickly knock it out before moving to the final line of code in the shim:</p>

<pre><code>export RBENV_ROOT="/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv"</code></pre>

<p>This line of code just sets a 2nd environment variable named <code>RBENV_ROOT</code>.</p>

<p>Referring back to the README.md file we just read, we see that this env var "Defines the directory under which Ruby versions and shims reside." Given we're <code>export</code>ing thie variable (i.e. given that this is an environment variable and not a shell variable), we can assume that this variable will be used by a child process, just like <code>RBENV_DIR</code> is.</p>

<p>In my case, the value to which this env var gets set is the <code>.rbenv</code> hidden directory inside my home directory, i.e. <code>/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv</code>.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>We only have one more line of code to go before we're done with our line-by-line examination of the shim, so let's try to power through to the end of the file. Once we're done, we can start putting together what the shim as a whole does.</p>
