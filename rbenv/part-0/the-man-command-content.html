<pre><code>set -e</code></pre>

<p>This is the first time we've encountered the <code>set</code> command, so let's look it up in the docs.</p>

<h2>How to look up a command in the docs</h2>

<p>In many cases, we can find the manual for various terminal commands using the <code>man</code> command (short for "manual"). If we fail to find what we're looking for using <code>man</code>, we can try checking StackOverflow or another source. But the quality of those sources can vary widely, so a useful habit is to stick to official docs when we can.</p>

<p>I've found that these <code>man</code> pages can be tricky to parse, and if the command you're looking up is a builtin (i.e. the command comes from your specific shell, rather than from UNIX itself; more on this later), then you'll get back a result which may be even harder to understand. Let's walk through an example.</p>

<h2>Experiment- looking up a <code>man</code> page</h2>

<p>One terminal command that most of us are familiar with by now is <code>ls</code>, which prints out the contents of a directory. Let's use that command as a springboard to help us learn about <code>man</code> pages.</p>

<p>If we type <code>man ls</code> in the terminal, the result that we get starts out like this:</p>

<pre><code>LS(1)            General Commands Manual             LS(1)

NAME
  ls – list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
  ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
  For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

  If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

  The following options are available:

  -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.

  -A      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot ('.') except for . and ...  Automatically set for the super-user unless -I is specified.

  -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx, where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.  This option is not defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1").

  -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

...</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the command's name and a brief description</li>
  <li>a synopsis of the command's usage (the order in which you'd type the command, its flags and args, etc.)</li>
  <li>a longer description of the command itself (here, "operand" means the argument you pass to <code>ls</code>)</li>
  <li>a list of the command's possible arguments and flags, and what each one does</li>
</ul>

<p>If we keep scrolling down the <code>man</code> page, we also see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a list of environment variables which affect how <code>ls</code> works</li>
  <li>a description of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230604005103/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33430/exit-code" target="_blank">exit code(s)</a> that <code>ls</code> might return, and under what conditions they might be returned</li>
  <li>examples of how to use the <code>ls</code> command</li>
  <li>various other bits of information which aren't immediately relevant to us</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not familiar with <code>man</code> pages, I recommend running <code>man ls</code> in your terminal, and skimming the results in order to get familiar with the typical format.</p>

<h2>Looking up the <code>man</code> page for <code>set</code></h2>

<p>Let's try looking up the above <code>set</code> command in its <code>man</code> page. I type <code>man set</code> into my terminal and I see the following:</p>

<pre><code>BUILTIN(1)                                                        General Commands Manual                                                       BUILTIN(1)

SYNOPSIS
      See the built-in command description in the appropriate shell manual page.

DESCRIPTION
      Shell builtin commands are commands that can be executed within the running shell's process.  Note that, in the case of csh(1) builtin commands, the command is executed in a subshell if it occurs as any component of a pipeline except the last.

      If a command specified to the shell contains a slash '/', the shell will not execute a builtin command, even if the last component of the specified command matches the name of a builtin command.  Thus, while specifying "echo" causes a builtin command to be executed under shells that support the echo builtin command, specifying "/bin/echo" or "./echo" does not.

      While some builtin commands may exist in more than one shell, their operation may be different under each shell which supports them.  Below is a table which lists shell builtin commands, the standard shells that support them and whether they exist as standalone utilities.

      Only builtin commands for the csh(1) and sh(1) shells are listed here.  Consult a shell's manual page for details on the operation of its builtin commands.  Beware that the sh(1) manual page, at least, calls some of these commands "built-in commands" and some of them "reserved words".  Users of other shells may need to consult an info(1) page or other sources of documentation.</code></pre>

<p>This <code>man</code> page looks a bit different. It doesn't mention the command name (<code>set</code>) in the top-left corner, the way the <code>man ls</code> results did.  Instead we just see the word "BUILTIN".</p>

<h2>Builtin vs. External Commands</h2>

<p>As it turns out, depending on the command you give it, sometimes <code>man</code> will give you documentation on that command (like it did with <code>ls</code>), while other times, it returns the above- an explanation of what a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230226091101/https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html" target="_blank">builtin command</a> is in UNIX.</p>

<p>So when does it give you one result, vs. the other?</p>

<p><a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/167004/why-dont-shell-builtins-have-proper-man-pages" target="_blank">The gist of it</a> is that <code>man</code> pages are provided only for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220709025237/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-and-external-commands-in-linux/" target="_blank">"external commands"</a>, i.e. commands which come from UNIX.  But the shell is not UNIX. UNIX is the operating system, and the shell is the application we're using to interact with the operating system.  In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220601094544/https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/shell" target="_blank">the reason it's called "the shell"</a> is because it surrounds the operating system, like an eggshell.</p>

<p>The <code>set</code> command is a builtin program provided by the shell, not an external command provided by UNIX. It's for this reason that shell authors keep the docs for their commands separate from the docs for external commands.  The filesystem can be a messy place, and it's important to maintain strict compartmentalization for the sake of keeping things organized.  As the British say, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRk0sjSgFU" target="_blank">everything in its right place</a>".</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>So how do we look up docs on builtin commands?  We can use the <code>help</code> command, which we'll do next (when we discuss the <code>set</code> command itself).</p>
