That's all for the `rbenv` command!  In this section, we learned:

 - What annotations are.
 - How to read RBENV's tests.
 - Testing happy paths, sad paths, and alternate paths.
 - What command substitution is.
 - What "red-green-refactor" and "test-driven development" mean.


During this section, we talked a bit about the `rbenv-init` command, the `sh-` commands, etc.
