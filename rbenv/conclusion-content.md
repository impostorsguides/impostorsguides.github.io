Where do we go from here?  A couple options:

## `ruby-build`

Back in the introduction to Part 2, we mentioned how you could install new versions of Ruby in an RBENV-friendly manner by using the `ruby-build` plugin.  But we didn't actually cover that plugin, because it was part of a separate codebase.  However, `rbenv install` is a not-uncommon command, and it might pay to dive into that codebase like we did here.

## Other Ruby version managers

Alternately, there are other Ruby version managers out there which are also quite popular, or are gaining in popularity.  Examples include [RVM](https://rvm.io/), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), and [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby).  I don't currently make use of these programs, so I know even less about them than I do about RBENV.  Just like learning a new programming language has taught me more about the languages I currently use, learning how other Ruby version managers work could teach me more about the approach that RBENV takes.

## Ruby's codebase

I'm feeling more confident about grokking codebases, now that I've finished reading RBENV's codebase.  I've started wondering if I could tackle even more challenging codebases, maybe even that of Ruby itself.  If I were to understand that, that would likely make it easier to understand code which is written in Ruby.

## Something else entirely?
