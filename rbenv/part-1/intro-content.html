  <h1 class="post-title">Introduction: The <code>rbenv</code> Command</h1>
</header>

<p>You made it to part 2!  If you haven't read <a href="/shell/introduction">Part 1</a> yet, I highly recommend you start there.  It contains both context on RBENV and bash syntax, which this next section depends on.</p>

<p>Having finished reading the code for RBENV's shims, we need to decide what's next.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/tree/c4395e58201966d9f90c12bd6b7342e389e7a4cb" target="_blank">the following files and directories</a> exist in the Github repo:</p>

$ </code></pre>

<p>When I look inside each of these directories, I see that <code>libexec/</code> has the most files in it. While this doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean that it's the most important directory, it does indicate that a lot of development has taken place in that directory.</p>

<p>It also means that, if we were to finish reading through all the files in that directory, we will have taken a big step toward understanding the codebase as a whole.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://gist.github.com/richiethomas/272b7719f3c75abf6818a8211552004e#file-bundle-L21" target="_blank">the last line in the shim file</a> we just examined was the <code>libexec/rbenv</code> file, located inside the <code>/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>exec "/Users/richiethomas/.rbenv/libexec/rbenv" exec "$program" "$@"</code></pre>

<p>Since the <code>libexec/rbenv</code> command is the file that our shim file executes, that would be a logical next step in our analysis. Coincidentally, this is also the first file in the <code>libexec/</code> directory, so it's already the file we'd start with if we were to work our way through the files in that directory.</p>

<p>For all of these reasons, let's start there.</p>
