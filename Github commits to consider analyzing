    Switch back to resolving symlinks for `rbenv` executable (#1439)

    Considerations:

    - `./libexec/rbenv` executable is the entrypoint to the program;

    - BASH_SOURCE might be the path to a symlink that has activated `./libexec/rbenv`;

    - We must resolve the symlink to learn where rbenv's libexec directory is;

    - It's not guaranteed that rbenv commands will always remain directly under their own "libexec" directory, since a package maintainer can change that, e.g. rbenv commands are sometimes placed into `/usr/libexec/rbenv/*`;

    - Resolving symlinks might fail and in that case we just assume rbenv project layout.
